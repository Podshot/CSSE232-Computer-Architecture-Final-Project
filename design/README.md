Design Directory
--------------------------------------

Put your design documents and journals in here. You can put other design-related documents (green sheets, etc) in here too.  Don't put Xilinx projects or any implementation artifacts in this directory.

Your Design Document should be a single document that you update each week.  You will not have multiple design documents (the one you make will grow).

For more information, see:
https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse232/Project/

Include:
* DesignDocument.pdf (or .docx or .html)
* DesignProcessJournal.pdf (or .docx or .html)
  - Document things your team decides as you make design decisions: why you chose certain designs, things that went wrong, etc.
* Your individual journals named Journal-[username].pdf
  - Document things you work on alone and how much time you spend on them.
